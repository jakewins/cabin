Here's our short list of chainsaw models for clearing land to build a cabin.
We need something bigger than a garden saw, but aren't getting into full time logging.
What model saw should I buy?

<!--more-->

## Short version

- You should buy a gas-powered saw with at least 40cc engine and 18" bar.

- Either buy a cheap new $160 random-brand saw and expect it to last the warranty period, or buy a Stihl model `MS-250` or higher, or a Husqvarna `440` or higher.

- If you buy Stihl or Husky, you can buy used and get a brilliant saw at reasonable prices. Don't buy other brands used as they lack proper service networks to keep the saws in good condition.

## Basic specs needed

As a baseline, two things matter for sizing the saw; bar length and engine strength.
The length of the bar determines the size trees you'll be able to fell, and the horse power follows from that as the minimum power needed to pull the chain through that length of wood.

For clearing forested land, you need at *a minimum of an 18" bar*, and *a minimum of 40cc engine*.
If you've got large trees and/or you are cutting hardwoods, displacement needs to come up above 42cc.

You'll also want to choose a somewhat modern saw with *protection against kickback* and a brand with solid history and service network.

## Brands

You can go two directions here. You can choose a cheaper home-owner saw from a less well known brand, or you can choose a semi-professional saw. A new home owner saw with 18" bar, 40+cc engine and kickback protection will run you about $160.

The alternative is to buy either German Stihl or Swedish Husqvarna ("Husky") semi-pro saws. These cost 2-3 times more, about $300-$600 for a Husky with the specifications we're looking for.

The benefit of the semi-pro saws is that, unlike Poulan and other homeowner brands, you can buy Stihl and Husky saws used.

So, ultimately, you have three options:

- New homeowner saw, like a Poulan: $150-$200
  - Pro: Cheap, comes with warranty
  - Con: No resale value, expect engine/carburetor issues past warranty period
- New semi-pro saw: $400-$600
  - Pro: Warranty, life-time machine if cared for
  - Con: Expensive
- Used semi-pro saw: $150-$400
  - Pro: Cheap, life-time machine if cared for
  - Con: No warranty, risk if prior owner did not maintain properly

## Models

If you do decide to buy a semi-pro saw, our initial requirements make it easy to narrow down which models fit the bill.

### Stihl

German-made, these saws can still be found used with "Made in West Germany" stamped into the steel.
If you are buying new, the model numbers you'll see start with `MS-`, and then a model id that denotes, roughly, the displacement of the saw.

The rule is simple: Any Stihl with a model number of `MS-250` will fit the bill.
Unless you're experienced in using chainsaws, you're likely better off with the smallest model you can find at or above `MS-250`.

If you are buying used, you'll also come across older Stihl model numbers starting with `0`, like `028`, `026`. These saws are louder and cruder than their modern brethren, and `028` does not come with kick-back protection. However, a used `026` saw is old enough today that you should expect $150-$200 for a saw in good condition, and would end up the owner of a professional-grade logging saw you can expect another 10-20 years of work out of.

In short: Buy the smallest saw you can find with a model at or above `MS-250` or look into `026` and related models.

### Husqvarna

Swedish-made, Husqvarna cut it's teeth in the expansive northern-european forests. Like Stihl, used professional-grade saws are widely available at attainable prices as the two brands have made up mostly the entire high-end market for chainsaws for decades.

Any Husky with a model number at or above `440` will have enough of a displacement and bar to clear mid-sized softwood forest. The 435 models have the same engine as 440, so you could buy a 440 and add an 18" bar.

In short: Buy `440` or higher.
